## Startup (Both backend and frontend need to be running for the health check to render on the app)

  ### Get the backend API running
  Navigate to the api folder and run: 
    npm install
    npm run dev

  ### Get the frontend running
  Navigate to the web folder and run: 
    npm install
    npm run dev

  After the first startup, you shouldn't have to run npm install unless dependencies have changed in the package-lock

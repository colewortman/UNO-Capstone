## Startup

> **Note:** Both backend and frontend need to be running for the health check to render on the app.

### Backend API

Navigate to the `api` folder and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Frontend

Navigate to the `web` folder and run:
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

> **Tip:** After the first startup, you only need to run `npm install` again if dependencies have changed in `package-lock.json`.
